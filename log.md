# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 27, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Created the Github repository for `build-my-app`. Drafted an initial plan for the application.

**Thoughts**: I am once again having a little bit of analysis paralysis. For the frontend of the app, I am looking at Flutter, VueJS and React. Neither of them are ideal for me at the time I suppose. Flutter uses Dart, which would be a completely new language for me. Next to that, web development support is currently still in beta. React has been used for quite some time, but I always heard it is quite difficult. Lastly, I've used VueJS before in the past, but didn't particularly enjoy it, so I'm not sure if I want to use this one. The struggles! Hey, but at least I started :) .
