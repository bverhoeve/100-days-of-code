# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 27, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Created the Github repository for `build-my-app`. Drafted an initial plan for the application.

**Thoughts**: I am once again having a little bit of analysis paralysis. For the frontend of the app, I am looking at Flutter, VueJS and React. Neither of them are ideal for me at the time I suppose. Flutter uses Dart, which would be a completely new language for me. Next to that, web development support is currently still in beta. React has been used for quite some time, but I always heard it is quite difficult. Lastly, I've used VueJS before in the past, but didn't have the time to learn it decently, so I'm not sure if I want to use this one. The struggles! Hey, but at least I started :) .

## Day 1: March 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Read a [re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) on MDN to rediscover how JavaScript works, and new quirks that were added since ES6. Worked through the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#why-immutability-is-important) to teach myself React by doing. It went well, and React seems like a decent framework as it was quite fun to work with and made sense all the way. I'll use React for the frontend of the app.

## Day 2: March 29, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started the boilerplate for the frontend of `build-my-app` using Create React. I added React-Bootstrap to my application as well to have some better visuals. I want to include a bootstrap theme to give the website a little bit more charm. So, the rest of my time went to looking at possible Bootstrap themes. One that I liked in particular is the [Lazy kit](https://technext.github.io/lazy-kit), which I'm probably going to use. I still need to add it in to the application though.

## Day 3: March 31, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I successfully added the [Lazy kit](https://technext.github.io/lazy-kit) to the application! Then I wrestled a bit with React Router to figure out how to add my own home page. But in the end, I managed to create a new default route to my own page and redirect the Lazy kit routes to other URLs.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit guilty about skipping on yesterday. I started out for a couple of minutes, but then a friend called and I forgot about coding until it was too late to get started even. I do feel that I made quite a bit more progress today than I did the previous days. Although the `build-my-app` is still in boilerplate mode, more and more of the foundations are being laid to work further on.

## Day 4: April 1, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Added a logo for Build My App. I added a navigation bar to the homepage. The layout isn't that nice yet but I'll fix it in the coming days.

**Thoughts**: I only started working on the application late in the evening but I still managed to get some stuff done.

## Day 5: April 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I started working on a smaller project and put Build My App on hold for now. The reason for this is that the smaller project is in the context of aiding people in need for COVID-19, which I do find important. The project I started is called `viper`, where I'll implement a Battlesnake in order to compete in the Battlesnake competition for the Food Banks in Canada (https://play.battlesnake.com/)

**Thoughts**: It has been a while that I've continued coding. I underestimated starting to work full time and still being able to commit to the challenge. I'll try again with the Battlesnake initiative!

## Day 6: April 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my Battlesnake. I've successfully deployed the app to the Heroku platform, which was challenging! I also started working on the API, but realized I'll need to test the app as well, so I've started working on testing with `pytest`.

**Thoughts**: I quite underestimated how rusty coding has become for me. I am a bit overwhelmed by all the things I once again need to learn, but I'll get there.

## Day 7: April 13, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on the Battlesnake. I started to work together with a friend on the app. The Battlesnake now has a functioning API and can play games against the Battlesnake engine. Next to that, the engine can now also run locally allowing to simulate games.

**Thoughts**: Today I started working on the Battlesnake together with a friend, which was a very good idea! We actually coded a lot longer than one hour, in fact it was the better part of the afternoon. It was fun to feed of each others energy, and we both could bring knowledge to the table.

## Day 8: April 18, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on my own on the Battlesnake. Implemented a basic collision detection algorithm that identifies the possible directions a snake can go in without dying.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to work on something.

## Day 9: April 19, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Battlesnake with [sanderdewilde](https://github.com/sanderdewilde) We fixed an issue in production and added an algorithm that finds food based on the Euclidian distance.

**Thoughts**: After deploying our snake and entering it into the global arena, it actually performed quite well! I'm happy to see the progress and I'm excited to see what will happen on game day.

## Day 10: May 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I've started a new side project called 'wolk' It'll be a website that will help me more easily compare virtual machines across cloud providers, since this is an issue that I often have during my day job.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit bad to continue on day 10, given that it has been so long that I've actually progressed with the 100 days of code. After the Battlesnake competition, I wasn't really motivated on working on the build my app project anymore
and I didn't feel like starting a new project. The other project just had a bit too large of a scope, so I've trimmed it down quite a bit with `wolk`. I hope by doing this that I can stick with the challenge better!

## Day 11: May 9, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a lot of time, so I've just added bootstrap and a button linking back to my Github repository to the website.

**Thoughts**: I'm hungry!

## Day 12: May 12, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I've made the top of the website a bit prettier, adding a navigation bar to the three main pages and the Github button.

**Thoughts**: I've decided to get up a little bit earlier than other days, so I could start the day with a 'quick win' by working on the site for about an hour. It feels pretty good having created something before my workday even started!
