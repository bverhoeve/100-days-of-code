# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: March 27, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Created the Github repository for `build-my-app`. Drafted an initial plan for the application.

**Thoughts**: I am once again having a little bit of analysis paralysis. For the frontend of the app, I am looking at Flutter, VueJS and React. Neither of them are ideal for me at the time I suppose. Flutter uses Dart, which would be a completely new language for me. Next to that, web development support is currently still in beta. React has been used for quite some time, but I always heard it is quite difficult. Lastly, I've used VueJS before in the past, but didn't have the time to learn it decently, so I'm not sure if I want to use this one. The struggles! Hey, but at least I started :) .

## Day 1: March 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Read a [re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) on MDN to rediscover how JavaScript works, and new quirks that were added since ES6. Worked through the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#why-immutability-is-important) to teach myself React by doing. It went well, and React seems like a decent framework as it was quite fun to work with and made sense all the way. I'll use React for the frontend of the app.
